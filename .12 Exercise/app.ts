//12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let friendsName: string [] = ["Fizza" , "Ayesha", "Mariyam", "Mahnoor", ]
let message : string = "\tHow are you Friend ?"


console.log (friendsName[0] + message)
console.log (friendsName[1] + message)
console.log (friendsName[2] + message)
console.log (friendsName[3] + message);
